# Developer Coding Evaluation

## Instructions
Say hello to the Cardinal Solutions coding evaluation. You'll be taking a single page mockup and converting it to HTML, CSS, Javascript. Fork this repository to begin your project. All assets (images, fonts) are included in the project. You're welcome to set up the code and folder structure however you wish. All HTML, CSS, and Javascript must be writen from scratch.

- Task runners like Gulp or Webpack can be used
- A pre-processor like Sass can also be used.
- UI frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, Material, may not be used.
- The UI may be build in static HTML or you may use React, Angular, Vue or the like.

Once complete, your site should be deployed to Github Pages.
